The ORDER BY clause performs a total ordering of the query result set. 
This means that all the data is passed through a single reducer, which may take an unacceptably long time to execute for larger data sets.

Hive adds an alternative, SORT BY, that orders the data only within each reducer, thereby performing a local ordering, where each reducer’s output will be sorted. Better performance
is traded for total ordering.

SELECT s.ymd, s.symbol, s.price_close
FROM stocks s
ORDER BY s.ymd ASC, s.symbol DESC;

1.ORDER BY can result in excessively long run time
2.Hive will require a LIMIT clause with ORDER BY if the property hive.mapred.mode is set to strict.

SELECT s.ymd, s.symbol, s.price_close
FROM stocks s
SORT BY s.ymd ASC, s.symbol DESC;

1. if more than one reducer is invoked, the output will be sorted differently
2. each reducer’s output files will be sorted, the data will probably overlap with the output of other reducers.
