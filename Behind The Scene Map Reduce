Hive Creates MAP REDUCE Job for the queries and executes then.
Lets see a en exmple Consider a query

SELECT COL2, COL3
FROM TABLE
WHERE COL1 = "X"
AND   COL4 = "Y"
For each row the input to map is 
<ROWNUM , Input ROW> ==>  [MAP] 
[MAP] ==> Will apply filter logic and output required columns. <ROWNUM , "COL2,COL3">
[REDUCER] Reducer acts like a Identity functions. Which takes input and return unmodified input
          <NULL, COL2,COL3> 

Group By & Having - Behind the scene
=====================================
SELECT COL4, MAX(COL5)
FROM TABLE
WHERE COL1 = "X"
GROUP BY COL4 
HAVING MAX(COL5) > Y

<Rownum,input row> ==> [map] ==> <Group by key , other columns> ==> REDUCER ==> <GROUP BY KEY , AGGREGATE COLUMNS >
Reducer will simply use the specified aggregation function to combine values that share the key 
The having condition will be checked inside the reducer before output is written

Hive Joins - Behind the scene
=======================================
Outer
Inner
Left
Right 

SELECT T1.COL4 , T1,COL7, T2.COL2, T2.COL4
FROM TABLE1 T1
OUTER TABLE2 T2
ON T1.COL1 = T2.COL1

<ROWNUM, <ROW, TABLENAME>>  ==> Input TO [MAP]
