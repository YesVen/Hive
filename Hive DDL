Here i would like to show different DDL statement for creating table for different file formats/data types

--In this DDL it shows how to create DDL with the datatypes like ARRAY/MAP/STRUCT 
CREATE TABLE employees (
name STRING,
salary FLOAT,
subordinates ARRAY<STRING>,
deductions MAP<STRING, FLOAT>,
address STRUCT<street:STRING, city:STRING, state:STRING, zip:INT>);

-- Here is the product table with fields delimiter is '|' and line terminated by '\n'

create table proudcts
(
product_id          	int ,                	                    
product_category_id 	int   ,              	                    
product_name        	string ,             	                    
product_description 	string  ,            	                    
product_price       	double   ,           	                    
product_image       	string   
) 
row format delimited 
fields terminated by '|'
line terminated by '\n';
