THE STINGER INITIATIVE: MAKING APACHE HIVE 100 TIMES FASTER
Overview of Stinger Initiative
  1.First, we are making Hive a more suitable tool for the decision support queries people want to perform on Hadoop.  
  This includes adding analytics features like the OVER clause, support for subqueries in WHERE, 
  and aligning Hive’s type system more with the standard SQL model.
  
  2. Second, we are optimizing Hive’s query execution plans and based on our initial changes, we have already seen query 
     time drop by 90% on some of our test queries. We are also looking at additional changes inside Hive’s execution 
     engine that we believe will significantly increase the number of records per second that a Hive task can process.
  3. Introduction of a new columnar file format (i.e. ORCFile) within the Hive community to provide a more modern, 
      efficient, and high performing way to store Hive data.
  4. And lastly, we’ve introduced a new runtime framework, called Tez, which aims to eliminate Hive’s latency and throughput 
     constraints that result from its reliance on MapReduce. Tez optimizes Hive job execution by eliminating unnecessary tasks, 
     synchronization barriers, and reads from and write to HDFS.  This optimizes the execution chain within Hadoop and drastically 
     speeds Hive’s workload processing.
     
     TECHNIQUE #1: USE TEZ 
                    set hive.execution.engine=tez;
     TECHNIQUE #2: USE ORCFILE
                    Store data in ORC Format
     TECHNIQUE #3: USE VECTORIZATION
