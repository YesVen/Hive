Hive Properties 

hive.mapred.mode = set to strict  Hive prevents users from inadvertently issuing a Cartesian product query

hive > SELECT * FROM stocks JOIN dividends
> WHERE stock.symbol = dividends.symbol and stock.symbol='AAPL';
This query computes the full Cartesian product before applying the WHERE
clause. It could take a very long time to finish

hive.auto.convert.join = true  // Take the advantage of map side joins. NO need to mention /*+ MAPJOIN() */

hive.mapjoin.smalltable.filesize=25000000 // Mention the size of small table for doing map side joins

hive.optimize.bucketmapjoin=true;
The data must be bucketed on the keys used in the ON clause
and the number of buckets for one table must be a multiple of the number of buckets
for the other table.
