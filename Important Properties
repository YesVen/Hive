hive.mapred.mode = set to strict  Hive prevents users from inadvertently issuing a Cartesian product query
                                  Hive asks for limit clause with ORDER BY Clause
hive > SELECT * FROM stocks JOIN dividends
> WHERE stock.symbol = dividends.symbol and stock.symbol='AAPL';
This query computes the full Cartesian product before applying the WHERE
clause. It could take a very long time to finish

hive.auto.convert.join = true  // Take the advantage of map side joins. NO need to mention /*+ MAPJOIN() */

hive.mapjoin.smalltable.filesize=25000000 // Mention the size of small table for doing map side joins

The data must be bucketed on the keys used in the ON clause
and the number of buckets for one table must be a multiple of the number of buckets
for the other table.
hive.optimize.bucketmapjoin=true;

If the bucketed tables actually have the same number of buckets and the data is sorted
by the join/bucket keys, then Hive can perform an even faster sort-merge join.

set hive.input.format=org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.io.BucketizedHiveInputFormat;
set hive.optimize.bucketmapjoin=true;
set hive.optimize.bucketmapjoin.sortedmerge=true;
hive.exec.parallel to true enables parallel execution
hive.exec.mode.local.auto to true

--Change number of reducer 
The default value of hive.exec.reducers.bytes.per.reducer is 1 GB. Changing this
value to 750 MB causes Hive to estimate four reducers for this job:
hive> set hive.exec.reducers.bytes.per.reducer=750000000;
--JVM Reuse 
JVM reuse is a Hadoop tuning parameter that is very relevant to Hive performance,
especially scenarios where itâ€™s hard to avoid small files and scenarios with lots of tasks,
most which have short execution times.

mapred.job.reuse.jvm.num.tasks = N
